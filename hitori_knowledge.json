        "[3] Lua is cross-platform software, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C,[4] and Lua has a relatively simple C application programming interface (API) to embed it into applications",
        "[5]\nLua originated in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time",
        "It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features",
        "As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its speed, portability, extensibility and ease-of-use in development",
        "History\n[edit]Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil",
        "[6]\nLua's predecessors were the data-description and configuration languages Simple Object Language (SOL) and Data-Entry Language (DEL)",
        "Lua syntax for control structures was mostly borrowed from Modula (if\n, while\n, repeat\n/until\n), but also had taken influence from CLU (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to reference parameters or explicit pointers), C++ (\"neat idea of allowing a local variable to be declared only where we need it\"[6]), SNOBOL and AWK (associative arrays)",
        "Dobb's Journal, Lua's creators also state that LISP and Scheme with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the list) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua",
        "[8]\nLua semantics have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time,[6] especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping",
        "Several features were added in new Lua versions",
        "Versions of Lua prior to version 5",
        "0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the MIT License",
        "Features\n[edit]Lua is commonly described as a \"multi-paradigm\" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types",
        "Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables",
        "Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes and other related features using its single table implementation; first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege",
        "In general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible meta-features that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm",
        "As a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension language or scripting language, Lua is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms",
        "Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as first-class functions, garbage collection, closures, proper tail calls, coercion (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), coroutines (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading",
        "local students = 10\nA comment in Lua starts with a double-hyphen and runs to the end of the line, similar to Ada, Eiffel, Haskell, SQL and VHDL",
        "The generic if then end\nstatement requires all three keywords:\nif condition then\n--statement body\nend\nAn example of an if\nstatement\nif x ~= 10 then\nprint(x)\nend\nThe else\nkeyword may be added with an accompanying statement block to control execution when the if\ncondition evaluates to false\n:\nif condition then\n--statement body\nelse\n--statement body\nend\nAn example of an if else\nstatement\nif x == 10 then\nprint(10)\nelse\nprint(x)\nend\nExecution may also be controlled according to multiple conditions using the elseif then\nkeywords:\nif condition then\n--statement body\nelseif condition then\n--statement body\nelse -- optional\n--optional default statement body\nend\nAn example of an if elseif else\nstatement\nif x == y then\nprint(\"x = y\")\nelseif x == z then\nprint(\"x = z\")\nelse -- optional\nprint(\"x does not equal any other variable\")\nend\nLua has four types of conditional loops: the while\nloop, the repeat\nloop (similar to a do while\nloop), the numeric for\nloop and the generic for\nloop",
        "Lua also supports closures, as demonstrated below:\nfunction addto(x)\n-- Return a new function that adds x to the argument\nreturn function(y)\n--[[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current\nscope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous\nfunction, Lua creates a closure",
